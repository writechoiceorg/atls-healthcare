This guide will walk you through ACS's quickstart tutorial. It will guide you through ACS's frontend app, teaching you how to create a shipment and a manifest and request pickups for your manifests.

## Step 1: Creating your First Shipment

To create your first shipment, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to **ACS's frontend app**.
2. Click on **Create Shipment** in the top-left corner of your screen. 
3. You will now be requested to fill in different forms:
   - **Address**: The address to which the shipment will be delivered.
   - **Package**: Detailed information about the packages in the shipment.
   - **Service**: Choose the date of the shipment and select the delivery service. The calendar with service options presents the date the shipment will be delivered.
   - **Accessorials** (optional): Select the needed accessorials for your shipment, from temperature control to dangerous goods, ACS offers a variety of possible selections.
   - **Reference** (optional): You can add a variety of key-value pairs to link shipments to your system's identifiers.
4. Finally, you will be presented with a summary of **Charges** for the shipment you are about to create.
5. Click **Submit** in the bottom-right corner to create your shipment.
6. After submitting it, ACS will present you with the shipment's label. Print it and add it to your shipment.

## Step 2: Creating a Manifest

Every new shipment will first need to be manifested before pickup can occur. Whenever a new shipment is created, the Manifest button will add it to the current count of shipments to be manifested.

      "sizing": "500px"
    }

To create a manifest, follow the steps below:

1. Start by clicking the **Create Manifest** button at the bottom-left corner. It looks like the image below:

   Your created shipments will be shown on the **Added Shipments** table.
2. Click on **Create Manifest**. It will present you with the Manifest Report. 

> ðŸ“˜ Manifested Shipments
> 
> Once a shipment is manifested, you won't be allowed to make changes to it.

4. Print the Manifest Report. You must present it to the driver, who will pick up your shipment.

## Step 3: Requesting Pickups

Pickup requests don't require a previously created manifest or shipment. This means you can schedule a pickup before creating both in ACS. All you need is an estimate of the pieces and weight of the shipments included in each pickup. 

Pickups can occur daily. ACS won't allow you to request more than one pickup a day. Another thing to keep in mind is that any pickup request made after 2 pm local time will be scheduled for the next day. Because of this, ATS suggests you request your daily pickup early in the morning and then start creating your shipments and manifest.

To request a pickup, follow the steps below:

1. Click on the **Request Pickup** option on the left side.
2. Set the necessary information for the pickup, such as:
   - Pickup Time: The time the shipments should be picked up.
   - Closing: The closing time for the pickup to occur.
   - Pieces: The approximate number of pieces of the shipments.
   - Weight: The approximate total weight of the shipments.
3. Click the **Request Pickup** button at the bottom of the form.

With this, you have completed this tutorial. Keep in mind that this is a quick overview of how to work with ACS, and you should go further into this documentation to learn the details of our product.
